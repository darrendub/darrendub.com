  <h3>Theme: Control</h3>
  <p><em>The power to influence behavior or the course of events.</em></p>
  <small>Revised: February 19, 2018 to focus on measuring goals and pairing them with existing habits based on Helen Tran's <a class="link-text" href="http://helentran.com/buildanyhabit">How to Build Any Habit</a> article.</small>

  <h4>Recap</h4>
  <p>I think I took on too many unmotivating goals, I found myself shying away from the health and thoughts goals.</p>
