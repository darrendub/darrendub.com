            <h3 class="type-xl type-bold">Understanding the Problem</h3>
            <p class="type-md">To start this project, I worked closely with my product and research partners to deeply understand this opportunity. Through our early feedback we had a signal from our customers and internal teams. Brian started to pull on that thread by kicking off a customer satisfaction survey. This provided us with a good starting point to define a job story and desired outcome statements.</p>
            <p class="type-md mt-lg"><em>Job Story</em></p>
            <p class="type-md"><b>When I see</b> trends and patterns in customer videos, <b>I want to</b> be able to share key insights, <b>so I can</b> prove decisions to stakeholders.</p>

            <p class="type-md mt-lg"><em>Desired Outcomes</em></p>
            <ul class="type-list type-md">
                <li>Minimize the time to find insights</li>
                <li>Minimize the time to build empathy</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="type-md mt-lg">As a squad, we worked on an opportunity solution tree using <a class="type-link" href="https://mural.co/">Mural</a>, each member contributed solutions to the opportunity. Brian categorized these solutions into four major themes: finding insights, polishing a story, sharing feedback with your team, and collaboration. These themes aligned with the results of the needs-satisfaction survey. Based on feedback and the needs of the business we decided to focus on the find opportunity.</p>

            <p class="type-md mt-lg"><em>Find Opportunity</em></p>
                <p class="type-md">Customers have a challenging time identifying, sorting, and selecting clips in the highlight reel.</p>

                <p class="type-md mt-lg">We developed some key metrics that would help us track that we were solving this opportunity:</p>
                <ol class="type-list type-md">
                    <li>Develop new functionality for customer to solve the ‚Äúfind‚Äù opportunity</li>
                    <li>Improving customer satisfaction with the highlight reel editor</li>

                <h3 class="type-xl type-bold">Experiments</h3>
                <p class="type-md">We had a clear opportunity and a set of possible solutions, it was time to experiment. I worked with our design manager, Scott Johnsen, to craft a vision‚Äîa further out solution‚Äîto solve these opportunities. This vision was informed by inspiration and iteration.</p>

                <p class="type-md mt-lg"><em>Inspiration</em></p>
                <p class="type-md">I started investigating applications with similar video player functionality, looking for patterns and moments of delight. Great experiences had intuitive dragging and dropping interfaces as well as the ability to preview changes in real-time.</p>

                <img class="mt-xl" alt="Group of screenshots from different websites" src="/img/case-studies/highlights/highlights-inspiration.png">

                <p class="type-md mt-lg"><em>Iteration</em></p>
                <p class="type-md">What I love about <a class="type-link" href="usertesting.com">UserTesting</a> is how easy it is to put something in front of another human, customer, prospect, etc. This makes getting quick feedback incredibly easy and cheap. Anthony and I came up with assumptions and hypotheses around specific elements and entire flows, I transferred those questions to pixels and we got to experimenting. We broke this vision down into deliverable pieces that always tied back to customer value. This allowed us to look down-range while also building to get there.</p>

                <p class="type-md"><b>‚ö°Ô∏è Instant Highlight Reels</b></p>
                <p class="type-md">UserTesting hosts a PanDE week, a hack-a-thon of sorts, bringing everyone from product, design, and engineering together in San Francisco. The theme of the week: Experiment. Teams were encouraged to validate ideas creatively, cheaply, and quickly through experiments. Since we were deep in thought on the highlight reel we decided to focus our efforts on that.</p>
                <p class="type-md mt-lg">Our customers prefer not to watch entire videos. After all, they are using our product to get insights not to watch videos. What if we could find a way to fast track them to those insights?</p>
                <p class="type-md mt-lg">Through some coding wizardry, we added a button to the product that instantly created a highlight reel based on a task. We quietly launched it during PanDE week without any communication to customers. In a month we had ~150 unique customers actively using it every month. In six months, we saw a 350% increase of customers just using the instant highlight reel tool. This was a great lesson in truly understanding the problem to lead and using quick experiments to gain confidence.</p>

                <p class="type-md mt-xl"><b>üè∑ Tags</b></p>
                <p class="type-md">Still reeling from PanDE week we focused all efforts on our tagging feature. Our product was always built by and for researchers. This led to amazing innovation in capturing feedback. This also led to very research-specific ways of capturing feedback. Our product had the capability for tagging using words written in [brackets]. The only place a customer could see a bracket tag was if she exported her test to an Excel file. There was a need to surface these tags in-app.</p>
                <p class="type-md mt-lg"> Tagging is not a new idea, heck it wasn‚Äôt even new to UserTesting. We wanted to be smart and not reinvent the tag on this one. We started by documenting specific behavior as well as examples of tags in the wild. By staying consistent with common patterns and releasing value as it was ready we were able to get tagging out quickly. This enabled customers to start using it providing us coverage for our next solutions: search and filters.</p>

                <p class="type-md mt-xl"><b>üîç Search and Filters</b></p>
                <p class="type-md">This was the piece that brought everything together. This enabled customers to broadly search and narrowly filter a list of clips to find exactly what they were looking for. We also implemented auto-complete for tags to help assist customers when trying to remember a tag. With the improved clip content, they could search for tester names, notes, and the test they came from. If customers knew exactly where they wanted to look for clips they could use the test filter. This helped them pinpoint the exact test or tests that contained their insights.</p>

                <p class="type-md type-white"><em>Develop new functionality for customer to solve the ‚Äúfind‚Äù opportunity</em></p>
                <p class="type-md type-white">We implemented tags, search, and filter in the effort to aide our customers in identifying, sorting, and selecting clips in the highlight reel. In three months, since we released tags, our customers had created 11,000 unique tags. We are averaging about 500 searches per week.</p>

                <p class="type-md mt-lg type-white"><em>Improving customer satisfaction with the highlight reel editor</em></p>
                <p class="type-md type-white">We sent out surveys before, during, and after releasing the improvements above and we improved our satisfaction by forty-four percent. Many customers commented on the improved clip design and dragging/dropping functionality as the reason for their positive feedback.</p>

                <p class="type-md mt-lg type-white"><em>Increasing the number of highlight reels created</em></p>
                <p class="type-md type-white">At the start of this initiative we were seeing around 300 highlight reels created per month. Post launch we saw that number skyrocket to 1,000. An increase of ~200%. Over fifty percent of the total highlight reels created were attributed to instant highlight reels. About seventy percent of customers who did create a highlight reel came back to create a second one.</p>

                <p class="type-md"><em>Always be experimenting</em></p>
                <p class="type-md">The theme for our PanDE week was around experimentation. We were empowered to choose a problem, write a hypothesis, track how we would validate or invalidate the experiment, and map out the appropriate next steps. This gave us a light weight way to test out ideas that treated failure as just another step in the process. This environment gave the team the confidence and space to develop the instant highlight reel feature. We had all the necessary pieces right in front of us and using the experiment lens helped us see the bigger picture.</p>

                <p class="type-md mt-lg"><em>Understand the problem and the solution will come</em></p>
                <p class="type-md">Anthony Raad, a staff UX researcher was instrumental in the success of this project. He gave us a look inside the mind of our customers through filtered feedback and interviews. By the time we exited the understand phase we knew the key features that would improve the experience for a lot of our customers. Brian, our fearless PM, led the charge on defining and scoping this opportunity to ensure we were focusing on solving the right things. By the time it came to put pixels on the screen our solution so solid that it had customers asking, ‚Äúwhen can I have this?‚Äù Working in this way made it incredibly easy for me to always map everything back to customer value.</p>
                <p class="type-md mt-lg"><em>Show your work</em></p>
                <p class="type-md">Our company is founded on the philosophy that getting feedback will make your product better. Feedback can come from anywhere and it was important for us to filter that feedback, especially internal feedback. We got a pretty strong signal from our early surveys and interviews that were were some unmet needs in the highlight reel. In a priority planning meeting a key stakeholder wasn‚Äôt so sure there was enough of a need here. The proposed solve was to do the bare minimum and move on to other pressing projects. These conversations are always challenging, when comparing a few top-level items how does a company choose where to invest time and money? However, as a team we felt this was an important initiative. We built our case around why we should make this investment and why we should make it now. We used the product as our customers do and presented clips of our interviews in the next planning meeting. Seeing the frustrated looks as our customers used the existing product and the hopefulness of their voice as they used our proposed vision was enough to convince that stakeholder that this was worth building.</p>
